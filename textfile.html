<h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1> 

<h4>Dear Eileen,</h4>

Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science<br> faculty to study as part of your<abbr></abbr> PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in<br> the following sections.

<h3>Starting dates</h3> 

We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it<br> would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each<br> one are as follows:

<ul> 
   <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li> 
   <li> Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
   <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul> 

Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
<br> <br>
You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates </a>  on our website.


<h2>Subjects of study</h2> 

At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long<br> as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an<br> intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.<br><br> Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of<br> priority:

<ol>
 <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub> O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub> H<sub>12</sub> O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
 <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding<br> 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup><br>  increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup> .)</li>
 <li> <u>HTML </u> and<u>CSS</u>  constructs for representing musical scores.</li> 

</ol>

So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long<br> you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you<br> think we'd need to know? Thanks.


<h2> Exotic dance moves</h2>

Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To<br> answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br><br>

<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
<dd> A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village<br> would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be<br> "fruitful".</dd>

<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt> 
<dd> Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice<br> this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and<br> shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my<br> fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as <br>Twerking.</dd>

<dt>Arctic robot dance</dt> 
<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s<br> believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted<br> movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on<br> however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really <br> cold.</dd>
